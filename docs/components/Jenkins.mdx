Trigger, monitor, and react to Jenkins builds

## Triggers

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="On Build Finished" href="#on-build-finished" description="Listen to Jenkins build completion events" />
</CardGrid>

import { CardGrid, LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Actions

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Trigger Build" href="#trigger-build" description="Trigger a Jenkins build and wait for completion" />
</CardGrid>

## Instructions

To set up the Jenkins integration:

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins** -> **Users** -> select your user -> **Configure**
2. Under **API Token**, click **Add new Token**, give it a name, and click **Generate**
3. Copy the token and paste it in the **API Token** field below

### Webhook Setup (for triggers)

To receive build events, install the **Jenkins Notification Plugin**:

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins** -> **Manage Plugins** -> **Available** tab
2. Search for **Notification Plugin** and install it
3. In your Jenkins job configuration, add a **Notification Endpoint**:
   - **Format**: JSON
   - **Protocol**: HTTP
   - **URL**: Use the webhook URL shown in the trigger configuration after saving the canvas

## On Build Finished

Triggers when a Jenkins build completes.

### Use Cases

- **Deployment pipelines**: Start deployments when CI builds succeed
- **Notifications**: Send alerts when builds fail
- **Workflow chaining**: Chain multiple Jenkins jobs through SuperPlane

### Configuration

- **Job**: Select the Jenkins job to monitor

### Event Data

Each build completion event includes:
- **job**: Job name and URL
- **build**: Build number, URL, and result (SUCCESS, FAILURE, UNSTABLE, ABORTED)

### Webhook Setup

This trigger requires the Jenkins Notification Plugin. Configure it in your Jenkins job
to POST build events to the webhook URL displayed after saving the canvas.

### Example Data

```json
{
  "build": {
    "number": 42,
    "result": "SUCCESS",
    "url": "https://jenkins.example.com/job/my-project/job/my-job/42/"
  },
  "job": {
    "name": "my-project/my-job",
    "url": "https://jenkins.example.com/job/my-project/job/my-job/"
  }
}
```

## Trigger Build

The Trigger Build component triggers a Jenkins job and waits for it to complete.

### Use Cases

- **CI/CD orchestration**: Trigger builds and deployments from SuperPlane workflows
- **Pipeline automation**: Run Jenkins jobs as part of workflow automation
- **Multi-stage deployments**: Coordinate complex deployment pipelines

### How It Works

1. Triggers the specified Jenkins job with optional parameters
2. Waits for the build to complete (via webhook from Jenkins Notification Plugin, with polling as fallback)
3. Routes execution based on build result:
   - **Passed channel**: Build completed with SUCCESS
   - **Failed channel**: Build failed, was unstable, or was aborted

### Configuration

- **Job**: Select the Jenkins job to trigger
- **Parameters**: Optional build parameters as key-value pairs (supports expressions)

### Output Channels

- **Passed**: Emitted when build completes with SUCCESS
- **Failed**: Emitted when build fails, is unstable, or is aborted

### Example Output

```json
{
  "data": {
    "build": {
      "duration": 120000,
      "number": 42,
      "result": "SUCCESS",
      "url": "https://jenkins.example.com/job/my-project/job/my-job/42/"
    },
    "job": {
      "name": "my-project/my-job",
      "url": "https://jenkins.example.com/job/my-project/job/my-job/"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-23T12:00:00Z",
  "type": "jenkins.build.finished"
}
```
