## Instructions

Jira supports two authentication methods. Choose the one that fits your use case:

## API Token

Use this method for simple setups that only need issue management (no webhooks).

1. Go to **Atlassian API Tokens** (https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click **Create API token** and copy the token
3. Select **API Token** as auth type below and enter your Jira base URL, email, and token

## OAuth 2.0

Use this method if you need webhook support (e.g. On Issue Created trigger).

1. Go to **Atlassian Developer Console** (https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/)
2. Click **Create** > **OAuth 2.0 integration**, name your app and agree to the terms
3. Go to **Permissions** and add these scopes under **Jira API**:
   - read:jira-work - Read issues and projects
   - write:jira-work - Create issues
   - read:jira-user - Read user info
   - manage:jira-webhook - Register and delete webhooks
4. Go to **Distribution**, click **Edit**, and set the status to **Sharing** to allow other users in your organization to connect
5. Go to **Settings** to find the **Client ID** and create a **Secret**
6. Select **OAuth 2.0** as auth type below and enter the Client ID and Client Secret
7. After creating the integration, go to the Atlassian app **Authorization** > **OAuth 2.0 (3LO)** and set the callback URL to your SuperPlane integration callback URL
8. Click **Connect** to authorize with Atlassian

## On Issue Created

The On Issue Created trigger starts a workflow execution when a new issue is created in a Jira project.

### Use Cases

- **Issue automation**: Automate responses to new issues
- **Notification workflows**: Send notifications when issues are created
- **Task management**: Sync issues with external task management systems
- **Triage automation**: Automatically categorize or assign new issues

### Configuration

- **Project**: Select the Jira project to monitor
- **Issue Types**: Optionally filter by issue type (Task, Bug, Story, etc.)

### Event Data

Each issue created event includes:
- **webhookEvent**: The event type (jira:issue_created)
- **issue**: Complete issue information including key, summary, fields
- **user**: User who created the issue

### Webhook Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a Jira webhook when configured. The webhook is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.

### Example Data

```json
{
  "data": {
    "issue": {
      "fields": {
        "creator": {
          "displayName": "John Doe"
        },
        "issuetype": {
